<v Announcer>The Hadley Instititute</v>

2
00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:05.327
for the Blind and Visually Impaired presents iFocus,

3
00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:09.034
tips on using the vision accessibility features on iOS.

4
00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:09.969
In today's installment,

5
00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.802
we'll look at setting accessibility shortcuts.

6
00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:16.643
<v Douglas>Hello, my name is Douglas Walker.</v>

7
00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:20.113
Today we are going to be taking a look

8
00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:22.690
at a really simple way that we have

9
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.147
for quickly turning on and off our most frequently

10
00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:29.408
used accessibility features,

11
00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:30.991
and we will do this

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.058
by setting up our accessibility shortcut.

13
00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:39.609
Now, once we set up our accessibility shortcut,

14
00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.275
we can simply just tap our home button three times

15
00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.654
to quickly toggle

16
00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:48.610
our favorite accessibility features on and off,

17
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.508
and of course our home button

18
00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:53.911
is the small round button here

19
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.152
at the bottom center of our screen.

20
00:00:56.152 --> 00:01:00.521
Now, we will be setting our accessibility shortcut

21
00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:04.071
to turn on and off voiceover today.

22
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.987
However, we could also set it

23
00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:08.032
to toggle on and off

24
00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:10.848
some of our other accessibility features as well,

25
00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:13.181
such as maybe our magnifier,

26
00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:16.751
or invert colors, or gray scale.

27
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.200
We could select zoom,

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.533
switch control, and even assisted touch,

29
00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.626
but like we said,

30
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.826
we will be selecting voiceover today.

31
00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:32.836
Now, we'll be using our iPhone for today's demonstration,

32
00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:37.745
but no worries there because this same method will work

33
00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.438
whether we're using our iPhone,

34
00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:42.188
our iPad, or even our iPod Touch.

35
00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:47.291
Now, some people also refer to our accessibility shortcut

36
00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:51.343
as our triple click home feature,

37
00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:53.143
and I'll tell you,

38
00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.892
this can be really useful,

39
00:01:54.892 --> 00:01:58.559
especially if we're maybe sharing our device

40
00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:01.846
with someone that doesn't necessarily need

41
00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:05.387
to use any of the accessibility features.

42
00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:08.063
Now, our accessibility shortcut setting

43
00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:10.481
is currently turned off,

44
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:13.221
so let's go ahead and take a quick look

45
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:15.865
at how to set up our accessibility shortcut.

46
00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:19.666
Now, our accessibility shortcut setting

47
00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.583
is under our accessibility settings

48
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:25.235
within our settings app,

49
00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:30.070
and our settings app is right here on our desktop.

50
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.355
So, how about we just flick to our settings app here,

51
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.841
and so we'll just flick.

52
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.399
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Settings.</v>

53
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:42.026
Double tap to open actions available.

54
00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:42.892
<v Douglas>All right,</v>

55
00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:45.259
and of course, here it is,

56
00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.351
so we will just single finger double tap to activate it,

57
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:51.427
and we'll just single finger double tap

58
00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:53.760
anywhere on our screen here.

59
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.313
(beeping)

60
00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:58.047
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Settings.</v>

61
00:02:58.047 --> 00:03:01.103
<v Douglas>Great, our settings app here has opened,</v>

62
00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:05.232
and we have been placed on our settings heading

63
00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:06.922
here at the top center of our screen,

64
00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:10.943
and of course just below the time here in our status bar.

65
00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:13.954
Now, our accessibility settings are actually

66
00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:16.097
within our general settings here,

67
00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:20.264
so we will just right flick quickly to our general button,

68
00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.822
and we'll just start right flicking here,

69
00:03:23.822 --> 00:03:25.482
and we'll right flick.

70
00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:26.315
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Settings.</v>

71
00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:27.148
Search field.

72
00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:27.981
<v Douglas>Search field.</v>

73
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:28.814
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Douglas Walker.</v>

74
00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:30.897
Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes store.

75
00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:32.273
<v Douglas Walker>iCloud settings there.</v>

76
00:03:32.273 --> 00:03:33.240
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Airplane mode, on.</v>

77
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.208
<v Douglas>And we're right flicking.</v>

78
00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:35.041
<v ->[Electronic Voice] WiFi, off.</v>

79
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:35.874
<v Douglas>Until we hear that click.</v>

80
00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:36.707
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Bluetooth, off.</v>

81
00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:37.661
<v Douglas>And we're looking for general.</v>

82
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:39.825
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Cellular, airplane, notifications.</v>

83
00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:40.658
<v Douglas>Notifications.</v>

84
00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:41.491
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Control center.</v>

85
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:42.324
<v Douglas>Control center</v>

86
00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:43.177
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Do not disturb.</v>

87
00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:44.010
<v Douglas>One more.</v>

88
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.678
<v ->[Electronic Voice] General button.</v>

89
00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:48.799
<v Douglas>Okay, and here is our general button.</v>

90
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.069
So we'll just go ahead an single finger double tap,

91
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.750
and it'll open up our general settings here.

92
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.000
So we'll just double tap anywhere here.

93
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:01.667
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Selected general settings.</v>

94
00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:02.810
Back button.

95
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.527
<v Douglas>Great, our general settings have opened for us,</v>

96
00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:08.714
and we've been placed on our back button

97
00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:11.680
here in the top left hand corner of our screen.

98
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.766
Now, remember, we're headed

99
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.648
to our accessibility settings here,

100
00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:17.707
so we'll just right flick

101
00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:20.891
until we find our accessibility button,

102
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.319
and so we'll just right flick here,

103
00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.241
and we'll right flick.

104
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.169
<v ->[Electronic Voice] General, heading.</v>

105
00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.002
<v Douglas>There's our heading.</v>

106
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:27.835
<v ->[Electronic Voice] About button.</v>

107
00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:28.787
<v Douglas>We're just right flicking here.</v>

108
00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:31.469
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Software update, spotlight search.</v>

109
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.157
<v Douglas>Just right flick.</v>

110
00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:36.335
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Home button, accessibility button.</v>

111
00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.742
<v Douglas>All right, and here is our accessibility button,</v>

112
00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:43.140
so we'll just single finger double tap,

113
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.657
and we'll just open them right up here,

114
00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:48.574
and we'll single finger double tap.

115
00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.993
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Selected accessibility,</v>

116
00:04:50.993 --> 00:04:53.027
general, back button.

117
00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:55.817
<v Douglas>Okay, and we're getting there.</v>

118
00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:57.784
Our accessibility settings, of course,

119
00:04:57.784 --> 00:04:59.628
have opened for us,

120
00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:03.364
and we've been placed once again on our back button here

121
00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:06.047
in the top left hand corner of our screen.

122
00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:08.680
Okay, our accessibility shortcut button

123
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.765
is actually the very last button

124
00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:14.031
in our accessibility list here.

125
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:15.866
Now, I tell ya,

126
00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.507
we could just keep right flicking

127
00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:19.267
through our accessibility list here.

128
00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:22.984
However, a really great gesture for moving

129
00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:25.185
through a really long list like this one

130
00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.268
is our three finger flick up gesture,

131
00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.794
but we first need to be within our list

132
00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:34.359
before we can actually use it,

133
00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:37.495
so how about we just right flick

134
00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:39.939
to the first item in our list.

135
00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.423
So we'll just right flick here until we get

136
00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:42.956
to the first item.

137
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.440
So we'll right flick.

138
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.698
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Accessibility heading.</v>

139
00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:46.624
<v Douglas>And that's our heading.</v>

140
00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:47.808
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Vision heading.</v>

141
00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:49.142
<v Douglas>And that's our vision heading.</v>

142
00:05:49.142 --> 00:05:51.175
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Voiceover on button.</v>

143
00:05:51.175 --> 00:05:53.644
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our voiceover button,</v>

144
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:55.508
and we heard, of course,

145
00:05:55.508 --> 00:05:59.660
voiceover announce that it's currently turned on,

146
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.041
and that's really great for us, right?

147
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.179
Okay, so let's just now use

148
00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.929
our three finger flick up gesture a few times

149
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.197
to quickly move through our accessibility list here.

150
00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:16.114
So we'll just three finger flick up

151
00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:19.383
until we get to the bottom of our screen here.

152
00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:21.300
So we'll just flick up.

153
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.373
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Rows nine to 19 of 31.</v>

154
00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:25.802
<v Douglas>And we'll flick up,</v>

155
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.485
we've got 31 items here, apparently.

156
00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:30.319
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Rows 18 to 27 of 31.</v>

157
00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.642
<v Douglas>I think we need to do it one more time,</v>

158
00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:33.749
so we just flick up again with three fingers.

159
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.290
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Rows 25 to 31 of 31.</v>

160
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.944
<v Douglas>Okay, so here we are at the bottom of our list,</v>

161
00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:42.689
and remember, our accessibility shortcut

162
00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.872
is the last item in our list here.

163
00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:49.407
So we'll just touch near the bottom edge

164
00:06:49.407 --> 00:06:51.791
of our screen and find it.

165
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:52.693
Hopefully find it here.

166
00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:54.360
So we'll just touch.

167
00:06:55.243 --> 00:06:57.961
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Accessibility shortcut, off button.</v>

168
00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:00.027
<v Douglas>All right, and we got lucky,</v>

169
00:07:00.027 --> 00:07:03.194
here's out accessibility shortcut button here.

170
00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:06.729
So we'll just single finger double tap to open it up,

171
00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.053
and so we'll just single finger double tap.

172
00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:15.154
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Selected accessibility shortcut.</v>

173
00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:16.481
Accessibility back button.

174
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.182
<v Douglas>Finally we're here, right?</v>

175
00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:20.926
And once again, we hear that we've been placed

176
00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:24.481
on our back button in the top left corner here.

177
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:27.539
Now what we have is a list here

178
00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.506
of items in which we can choose to be toggled on and off

179
00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:35.924
when we triple click our home button here,

180
00:07:35.924 --> 00:07:39.259
and of course, voiceover is one

181
00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.193
of the items here in our list.

182
00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:44.259
So, how about we just right flick

183
00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.517
until we find voiceover?

184
00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.646
And so let's just right flick

185
00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:50.145
until we get to voiceover here,

186
00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:51.612
and we'll right flick.

187
00:07:51.612 --> 00:07:53.712
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Accessibility shortcut heading.</v>

188
00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:54.545
<v Douglas>There's our heading,</v>

189
00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:55.378
so we'll just right flick again.

190
00:07:55.378 --> 00:07:56.280
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Triple click</v>

191
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.968
the home button for heading.

192
00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:00.695
<v Douglas>Okay, and this is sort of a descriptor</v>

193
00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:02.613
of our heading for triple clicking here.

194
00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:03.943
So we'll just right flick again.

195
00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:05.179
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Voiceover.</v>

196
00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:06.733
<v Douglas>Great, and here it is.</v>

197
00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:11.072
Voiceover is the very first item in our list here,

198
00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:13.822
and now, if we want to select it,

199
00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:17.499
you probably guessed that all we need to do

200
00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:19.301
is just single finger double tap.

201
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:23.468
So we'll go ahead and just single finger double tap here.

202
00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:26.664
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Selected voiceover.</v>

203
00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:30.204
<v Douglas>All right, we heard voiceover announce</v>

204
00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:33.237
that voiceover is now selected.

205
00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:36.288
Now, we could continue to right flick

206
00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:37.972
through our list here,

207
00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:41.023
and we could choose other items

208
00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:44.372
that could serve as our accessibility shortcut as well,

209
00:08:44.372 --> 00:08:46.958
like we said our magnifier,

210
00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.610
or invert colors, or gray scale,

211
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.761
or even zoom, switch control,

212
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.379
and even assisted touch.

213
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.548
However, like we said,

214
00:08:56.548 --> 00:08:58.881
today's all about voiceover.

215
00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:03.114
So now that we have voiceover selected,

216
00:09:04.547 --> 00:09:06.507
hey, why don't we give it a try?

217
00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:09.668
We will just triple click our home button,

218
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:13.848
and we should be able to quickly turn off voiceover here.

219
00:09:13.848 --> 00:09:17.396
So let's just press our home button

220
00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:20.128
here quickly three times for us,

221
00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:21.711
and we'll just tap.

222
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:25.512
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Voiceover off.</v>

223
00:09:25.512 --> 00:09:28.481
<v Douglas>All right, and hey that was pretty fast.</v>

224
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:32.429
Voiceover announced that it is now off,

225
00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:35.521
and of course we can now interact

226
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.748
with our device using just standard touch gestures,

227
00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:44.286
and then if we want to quickly turn on voiceover again,

228
00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:47.679
well we can just triple click our home button,

229
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:51.662
and since my iPhone isn't much good for me

230
00:09:51.662 --> 00:09:53.412
without voiceover on,

231
00:09:54.412 --> 00:09:56.872
let's just go ahead and triple click our home button,

232
00:09:56.872 --> 00:09:59.050
and we'll turn it back on here.

233
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.883
Okay, so we'll just quickly triple click here.

234
00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:05.485
<v ->[Electronic Voice] Voiceover on.</v>

235
00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:08.188
Settings, accessibility, back button.

236
00:10:08.188 --> 00:10:10.986
<v Douglas>And there you go.</v>

237
00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:14.328
Voiceover, of course, is back on,

238
00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:16.078
and we're good to go.

239
00:10:17.638 --> 00:10:18.471
I tell ya, you know,

240
00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:23.189
it really is fantastic that we have a really simple method

241
00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:27.610
for quickly turning our accessibility features on and off.

242
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.292
Again, my name is Douglas Walker.

243
00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:33.310
Take care, and I'll see you next time.
