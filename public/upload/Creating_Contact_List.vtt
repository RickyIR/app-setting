00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.940
- Hi, I'm Ed Haines with Hadley.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.180
Do you or your family members know who to call

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.080
when disaster strikes?

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.480
In this session, we're going to address

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.420
an important part of emergency response,

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.180
an emergency contact list.

7
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.710
With what we'll learn in less time than it takes

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.880
to watch a TV show, we'll be able to organize our

9
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.470
contacts in a way that will change how

10
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.070
we respond to an emergency.

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.170
Anyone who's been through a power outage,

12
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.580
knows how frustrating it is to search for a utility

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.230
company's phone number.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.090
Coping with emergencies effectively means knowing how to

15
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.500
quickly contact the people and systems we need for help.

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.350
Now, we know what essential information we need, but we

17
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.200
often haven't put that knowledge into practice.

18
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.000
In other words, our important emergency contact

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.960
information is all over the place, and not collected

20
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.190
into one easy-to-access list.

21
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.310
Now, most of us don't have an organized system.

22
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.860
We have some phone numbers in our address book,

23
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.530
some are on the refrigerator,

24
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.780
some times we have to find numbers on the internet.

25
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.190
That's not always an option during a power outage

26
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.930
when your router's down.

27
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.100
And this type of disorder, it's not helpful.

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.510
It's important to have all our information immediately

29
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.640
ready and accessible to everyone in the household.

30
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.610
Let's talk about some of the obvious emergency contact

31
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.900
information we need, and don't worry,

32
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.770
we'll have templates available as a resource for you

33
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.280
to easily create your own list.

34
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.660
First, you need your medical information.

35
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
The phone numbers of your doctors, dentists, local hospital,

36
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.090
pharmacist, and specialists, like optometrists.

37
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.410
You'll also need the phone numbers for your community

38
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.140
resources like the police, fire departments,

39
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.220
poison control center, Red Cross,

40
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.260
utility companies, et cetera.

41
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.150
It's also helpful to have the phone numbers of relatives

42
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.040
and friends you can count on for assistance and

43
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.350
if there are children or grandchildren in your

44
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.660
household, you need the pediatrician's

45
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.420
and school numbers, too.

46
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.400
Some less obvious numbers we could include on our list

47
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.470
would be an attorney, insurance agent, plumber,

48
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.810
electrician, heating and air technician, and

49
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.010
an internet provider.

50
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.460
And if you live in an apartment,

51
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.270
you need the number for your building's supervisor.

52
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.880
If you have pets, or a service animal,

53
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.140
include information for the veterinarian and

54
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.040
the local animal shelter.

55
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.850
And finally, it's important to have the number of

56
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.710
a relative or friend, some distance from us,

57
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.760
where we might stay if we have to evacuate.

58
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.540
There are probably many, many other numbers

59
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.250
you can think of, but for now, the important thing

60
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.840
to remember is that we need to include crucial contact

61
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.420
information having to do with all aspects of our life.

62
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020
And everyone in the family should have access to

63
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.790
this list and be able to read it.

64
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.340
So if the list is brailed, keep a print copy as well,

65
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.190
if there are sighted family members in the home.

66
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.200
If there are children and they're old enough,

67
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.940
the children should know which numbers to call, and

68
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.740
when to call them.

69
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.490
Now you might be thinking, I already have all these numbers

70
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.648
in one place, they're on my mobile phone contact list.

71
00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:14.410
But here's a problem.

72
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.520
Most of us lock our phones for security.

73
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.880
Our contact list is not accessible on a locked phone, so,

74
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.190
if someone other than ourselves needs to access

75
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.658
the list, they can't.

76
00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:29.100
Now there are ways to make sure your emergency contacts

77
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.690
show up on your locked screen of your mobile device.

78
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.500
So if that's where you want to keep them,

79
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.850
a bit of homework is needed.

80
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.910
Each device has different settings for making that possible.

81
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.360
But again, if the phone is away from home with the owner,

82
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.780
so is the emergency contact list.

83
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.700
There's one more piece of information we need to organize

84
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.820
and include in our contact list and

85
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.160
that is an evacuation destination.

86
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.210
If we have to evacuate, where would we go and

87
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.240
how would we get there?

88
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.530
If possible, have at least two destinations.

89
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.928
Places like shelters, or relatives, or friends homes.

90
00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:08.870
Also, if possible, everyone in the household should know

91
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.870
how to get to these destinations.

92
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.840
That means knowing the streets, the turns, the cardinal

93
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.640
directions, the landmarks, distances, et cetera.

94
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.170
We should be able to direct a complete stranger to our

95
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.640
place of safety without relying on anyone for directions.

96
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.410
Some of us who are non-drivers sometimes rely on others to

97
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.260
get us from Point A to Point B.

98
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.780
That's fine, but we often don't pay much attention

99
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.930
to routes and directions.

100
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.080
That's a luxury we can't afford in an evacuation.

101
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.700
Remember, you are better off if you are responsible as much

102
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.820
as possible for your own orientation.

103
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.310
So get busy!

104
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.430
Remember how I said in less time than it takes

105
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.730
to watch a TV show, you could make a useful impact on

106
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.670
you and your family's safety?

107
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.200
Putting together an emergency contact list

108
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.150
won't take much time, but having one handy when you need it,

109
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.749
will make all the difference in an emergency.

110
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.166
(soft music)
